Vocabulary Mastery Platform: Contextual Learning & Guaranteed Retention
The Vocabulary Mastery Platform is a research-driven, web-based application specifically engineered to assist native Marathi speakers in acquiring English proficiency through long-term memory consolidation. Unlike traditional dictionaries that prioritize immediate translation, this platform bridges the linguistic gap using a dual-strategy approach of contextual learning and an intelligent retention engine

Core Methodology & Research Principles
This platform addresses the pedagogical gaps of "single exposure" learning through three key cognitive principles:

1. Active Recall & Effortful Learning
Instead of passive reading, the system utilize MCQ-based quizzes and practice modules that force the brain to engage in "effortful" learning. This "struggle" builds deeper neural connections, ensuring the word actually sticks.

2. Spaced Repetition System (SRS)
Based on the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve, the platform tests users at expanding intervals (1 day, 3 days, 1 week, etc.) to combat memory decay.

3. The "Self-Cleaning" Inventory
To solve "review fatigue," the platform uses a data-driven algorithm that monitors mastery levels. A word is only moved to the "Mastered Inventory" after a user demonstrates a verified 5-test successful streak over an 8-week cycle.

Backend (Processing Layer)
Framework: Spring Boot (Java) utilizing a RESTful architecture.

AI Integration: Integrates a Generative AI (DeepSeek/Grok) module to synthesize Marathi-English "contextual bridges," providing detailed meanings, explanations, and three real-life usage examples.
